i dint found any script for that game, probly cause the remotes names are randomly generated on each game
btw, it was ez to bypass
also its open source

^^ sadly we gonna have a massive amount of skids copying my code(even though its easy to do)
i dont care to the skids but, it gonna be hard to found a "good script" that hasnt be made with the ass

thx bye
